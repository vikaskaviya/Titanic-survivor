# Titanic-survivor
The job was to predict if a passenger survived the sinking Titanic or not with the help of machine learning. Majority of the task was to analyze what sorts of passengers were likely to survive the tragedy through graphs, analytics tools and ML modules.


## Introduction:

In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. This project explores a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.

From a sample of the RMS Titanic data, we can see the various features present for each passenger on the ship:

- Survived: Outcome of survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Socio-economic class (1 = Upper class; 2 = Middle class; 3 = Lower class)
- Name: Name of passenger
- Sex: Sex of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)
- SibSp: Number of siblings and spouses of the passenger aboard
- Parch: Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number of the passenger
- Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
- Cabin Cabin number of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)
- Embarked: Port of embarkation of the passenger (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
